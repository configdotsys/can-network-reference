# CAN Network Reference

This repository contains selected technical reference notes compiled as a working reference for CAN bus networks in embedded systems.

The material is not intended to be a tutorial, textbook, or original theoretical contribution. Instead, it consolidates practical configuration details, timing heuristics, debugging observations, and validated operating behavior commonly encountered during CAN bring-up and development.

Notes are organized to support long-term reuse alongside embedded firmware development and system-level debugging.

### Contents

- CAN bring-up and IOC configuration reference  
- bxCAN controller runtime behavior and error handling  
- Physical-layer debugging and failure signatures  
- CAN bit-timing heuristics and configuration patterns  
- Validated operating baseline and closure summary  

### Intended Use

These notes are intended as a personal engineering reference for:

- embedded firmware development  
- CAN network bring-up  
- debugging and validation  
- reuse across future CAN-based projects  

They prioritize clarity, traceability, and practical engineering behavior over formal presentation.
